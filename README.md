This repository contains a set of koans for diving into the world of functional
programming in Javascript.

The aim is to impart principles from [ramda][ramda] and [fantasy-land][fantasy]
using a hands on approach. After this lesson, you should be familiar with most
of the basic principles, (and possibly the more advanced ones).

Usage
-----

First get the koans.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MrRacoon/js-fp-koans.git
cd js-fp-koans
```

It's suggested to start from the beginning and working your way through the
koans in order.

Open the koan, and read through it, and replace every instance of `REPLACE` with
the appropriate value.

You should check your progress as you go. Every file can be tested individually
by running the corresponding `test:#` npm script.

For example, if you are working on `1-booleans` you would run `npm run test:1`.

Good luck, have fun.
